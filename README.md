# 🕰️ TimeEcho

**Immersive Historical Storytelling with Generative AI**

TimeEcho is a generative AI-powered project that transforms historical events into immersive, first-person experiences. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), embeddings, multimodal generation, and persona-based narratives, TimeEcho makes history feel alive, emotional, and personal.
